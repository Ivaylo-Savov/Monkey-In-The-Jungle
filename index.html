                    <p>The Dancing Monkeys by Aesop A PRINCE had some Monkeys trained to dance. Being naturally great
                        mimics of men's actions, they showed themselves most apt pupils; and when arrayed in their rich
                        clothes and masks, they danced as well as any of the courtiers. The spectacle was often repeated
                        with great applause, till on one occasion a courtier, bent on mischief, took from his pocket a
                        handful of nuts, and threw them upon the stage. The Monkeys, at the sight of the nuts, forgot
                        their dancing and became (as indeed they were) Monkeys instead of actors, and pulling off their
                        masks and tearing their robes, they fought with one another for the nuts. The dancing spectacle
                        thus came to an end, amidst the laughter and ridicule of the audience.</p>
                    <p>Moral: They who assue a character will betray themselves by their actions.</p>
